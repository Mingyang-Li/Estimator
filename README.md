# Estimator

This project has been archived due to lack of architecture and maintainability, a new repository is created as a continuation of this project, except it will be more structured in terms of component, props, contexts, etc. The new project repository URL is https://github.com/Mingyang-Li/Quote-Estimator

A live demo can still be found on https://estimator-archived.netlify.app/

This project was for practice. I built it trying to grasp the basics of React. It was built on top of one of the Youtube turorials from Traversy Media: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zT62eVxShsY. Most of the original code has been replaced by my own from a number of novice attempts as you can see from the commit history.

The goal of this project was to build a simple SPA that helps calculating the costs for building web apps.
